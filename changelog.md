# Change log

## v1.5.1 - 22/07/2021
* BUGFIX in output of final simulation state:
  1. interactions table was read without dilution
  2. interactions table was only read at the end in the case of suppression of transverse fields, so the exchange interaction remained in the other case
* Added option to force binning
* Added exception when binned data is read that seeds that do not include a given temperature (perhaps they were created during the binning process) are just skipped.
* Added Jupyter notebooks
* Moved definition of Jex to the submitting scripts
* Added important directory info to the README
* Added MSc thesis to docs
* Extended documentation and removed unused scripts
