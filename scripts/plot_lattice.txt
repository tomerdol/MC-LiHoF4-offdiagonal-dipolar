(* Mathematica script to create a 3D plot of a magnetic system. Spins are plotted as dots with colors (yellow or green) indicating their orientation (up or down)
The system to plot is read from the file temp_lattice.txt in the scripts dir.
The required format is that each row look like: x,y,x,s
E.g. -0.775731,-0.275482,2.88103,1
The resulting figure is saved in 'lattice_output.png'.*)
