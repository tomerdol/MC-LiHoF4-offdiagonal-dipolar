1.0.1b:
* Fixed scripts for creating interpolation table
* Name extension for field interpolation table file can be given as commandline argument.
* Removed 'broyden' from file names
* Added crystal+field+hamiltonian-transversal+field+broyden.py and initiating scripts that create the interpolation tables.
